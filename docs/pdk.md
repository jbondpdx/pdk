## Puppet Development Kit

The Puppet Development Kit (PDK) is a package of development and testing tools to help you create great Puppet modules.

The PDK includes key Puppet code development and testing tools for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X workstations, so you can install one package with the tools you need to create and validate new modules. PDK includes testing tools, a complete module skeleton, and command line tools to help you create, validate, and run tests on Puppet modules. PDK also includes all dependencies needed for its use.

PDK includes the following tools:

Tool   | Description
----------------|-------------------------
pdk | Command line tool for generating and testing modules
rspec-puppet | Tests the behavior of Puppet when it compiles your manifests into a catalog of Puppet resources.
puppet-lint | Checks your Puppet code against the recommendations in the Puppet Language style guide.
puppet-syntax | Checks for correct syntax in Puppet manifests, templates, and Hiera YAML.
metadata-json-lint | Validates and lints `metadata.json` files in modules against  Puppet's module metadatastyle guidelines.
rspec-puppet-facts | Adds support for running rspec-puppet tests against the facts for your supported operating systems.
puppetlabs_spec_helper | Provides classes, methods, and Rake tasks to help with spec testing Puppet code.


## Getting started

To get started, install the PDK, and then create and test a module.

<!--TK: overview workflow graphic-->

1. [Generate a module](./pdk_generating_modules.md) using the `pdk new module` command.
1. [Validate your module](./pdk_testing.md), to verify that it is well-formed.
1. [Unit test](./pdk_testing.md) your module, to verify that all dependencies and directories are present.
1. [Generate a class]](./pdk_generating_modules.md) for your module, using the `pdk new class` command.
1. Validate and unit test your module to verify that the new code was created correctly.

PDK can unit test code that it generates, but for any other code you add, you'll need to write unit tests. As you add code to your module, be sure to validate and unit test your module both before and after adding code. This ensures that you are always developing on a clean, valid codebase.
